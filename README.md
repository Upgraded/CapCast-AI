# CapCast

CapCast is an AI-driven sports betting side project — currently being built out as I learn frontend and deployment tooling in real time.

The core idea: type in a matchup or betting-related prompt, and get back a concise prediction with a confidence percentage. Eventually this will be powered by actual stats, trends, and a lightweight model or API layer. Right now it's mostly placeholder logic and basic UI work.

## Status

- Live: [capcast.struts.ai](https://capcast.struts.ai)
- Frontend: Basic layout, styled input/output, email capture UI in place
- Backend: None yet — predictions are hardcoded
- Email: Not wired up (will use Formspree or similar)

## Stack (so far)

- HTML / CSS / JS
- GitHub + Vercel for deployment
- Dynadot for domain

## Next Steps

- Connect email form
- Replace static prediction with AI or stat-driven response
- Add real-time matchup parsing (e.g. injuries, spreads)
- Clean up layout + responsiveness
- Branding later, not a priority

This repo is mostly me figuring things out as I go. If you stumbled across it — feel free to fork, suggest improvements, or ignore entirely.
